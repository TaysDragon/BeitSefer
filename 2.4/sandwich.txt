Instructions:

Add in the missing code such that clicking any of the sandwiches causes…

An alert message to popup saying something snarky about the sandwich type.

A second alert message that displays to the user the number of that specific sandwich they’ve eaten.

HINT: You will need counter variables.

BONUS: Add an image to the image-div on the click event.
