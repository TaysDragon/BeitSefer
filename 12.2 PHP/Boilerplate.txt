Instructions

Unzip Boilerplate.zip and fire up a server on port 8000.

Look up PHP's documentation on superglobals: http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php

Open content.php. In your browser, change the URL to the following:

http://localhost:8000?name=John&email=john@doe.com

You might want to read about query strings for this part: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string

Next, add <? php print_r($_GET) ?> just after opening your container div.

Dicuss what you see with your partner. Be ready to share your thoughts with the class.

Reset the URL and enter a name and email with the form. Note the URL. What effect do you think this has on $_GET?

Repeat the above step, but change the form's method to POST. What effect does this have on the URL? Which superglobal do you think this information is in?
