Instructions

Refactor the slacked-out code to use the shorthand variable declaration syntax.

Likewise, re-factor the code to use ES6 object destructuring.

As always, confirm that the code still works exactly like it did before you re-factored it.

BONUS : Use Sets and Maps in your re-factor! And research when you would use a Set or a Map over an Object or an Array.
