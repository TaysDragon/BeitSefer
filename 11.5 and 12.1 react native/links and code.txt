 PRO TIP
  When you see Red Box with stack trace, you can click any
  stack frame to jump to the source file. The packager will launch your
  editor of choice. It will first look at REACT_EDITOR environment
  variable, then at EDITOR. To set it up, you can add something like
  export REACT_EDITOR=atom to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc depending on
  which shell you use.
