Instructions

With a partner, spend the next few moments studying the code just Slacked to you.

Then write code below each comment to log the relevant information about the provided car object.

Bonus: If you finish early, create a brand new object of your own. Slack out a snippet of the code to the class when you are done. Be creative!
