Instructions:

For the next 20 minutes, focus all your efforts on creating the application layout for your site.

This phase involves both:

Creating the overall HTML/CSS/Bootstrap Layout

Creating the initial .on("click") event that will dynamically trigger new HTML rows to be generated.

This phase DOES NOT involve sending or receiving data to Firebase.

If you finish early:

Continue refining the design! Take things to the next level. Make this application portfolio-grade!

Begin reading about push({}) and .on("child_added") in the Firebase documentation.


Instructions
Using your newfound knowledge of the .push({}) method, create the code necessary to push employee data into the database upon clicking the submit button on your webpage.
NOTE: Don't worry about getting the data to display in the HTML just yet. Just focus on getting data pushed to the database.
If you finish early, begin reading about .on("child_added") in the Firebase documentation and/or the MomentJS library.
