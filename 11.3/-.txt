Spend the next 20 minutes taking the design provided to you and breaking it into routed child and grandchild components.

As a starting point, create a basic route that flips between two panels on button click.

As a bonus, nest buttons and panels inside one of these child panels. The buttons should flip between these "grandchild" panels.

This may be tricky! Fight through it!
