Instructions:

Create a similar "Feed Me Seymour" game to the one shown just now.

Your game should be composed of one parent component (Seymour) and three child components (Tasty Treats).

Clicking buttons inside of the child components should increase the total "consumed" shown in Seymour's component by different amounts.

Once Seymour has consumed more than 500 an alert should be triggered saying something like: "Seymour is full!"
